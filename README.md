# 👕 Clothing Store Data Analytics Dashboard
## 🎯 Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of a simulated retail **Clothing Sales Dataset** to identify key performance indicators (KPIs), sales trends, and top-performing products/stores. The goal was to transform raw transaction data into actionable business intelligence using **Tableau Public** for visualization.

This dashboard provides stakeholders with a clear, interactive view of the store's performance throughout 2023.

* **Total Sales:** **$488.75K** from 12.1K units sold.
* **Best-Selling Category:** **Tops** generated the highest revenue, indicating strong demand for items like T-shirts.
* **Top Products:** **T-shirt**, **Jeans**, and **Hoodie** were the primary revenue drivers.
* **Sales Trend:** Sales showed a peak during the **summer (July)** and a strong performance heading into the holiday season, with **Store ID 101** being the highest contributor.

## ✨ Problem & Solution
**Problem:** The business needed a centralized, dynamic way to track key sales metrics, identify high-demand products, and understand sales trends that were previously buried in static transactional data.

**Solution:** I implemented a BI solution that provides stakeholders with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as Total Sales, Total Quantity, and Total Transactions. The dashboard highlights critical performance areas, including the monthly sales curve and the top-performing product categories (e.g., Tops) and stores.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

* **Data Source:** CSV File (6.1K rows)
